<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Kingsley Chibuikem Chife, but I go by the nickname Rawfile. I am a photographer from Awka-South in
Anambra state, Nigeria, and I started my photography journey in March 2018.</p>

<p>I have had the opportunity to work at some amazing studios in the region. I started my career at G24 Studios in 2018 and
worked there until 2019, before moving on to De Prime Studios where I worked until 2020. I then joined Velox Studio as a
Photographer and Manager from 2020 to 2022. I am currently a freelancer, focusing on providing high-quality photography
services to clients.</p>

<p>My education started at Udeozo Memorial Primary School, where I attended from 2000 to 2009. I then attended
Comprehensive Secondary School, where I obtained my WAEC (West African Examination Council Certificate) in 2015.
Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Nnamdi Azikiwe University and learning to become a full stack developer.</p>

<p>Outside of photography and coding, I enjoy reading and exploring new opportunities to learn and grow. I am passionate
about becoming a full stack developer and pursuing a career in tech.</p>
